* Tk::ObjScanner
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tkobjscanner
  :END:
Tk::ObjScanner is a Perl/Tk module that provides a GUI to scan any perl
data including the attributes of an object.

The scanner is a composite widget made of a HList. This widget acts as a
scanner to the object (or hash ref) passed with the 'caller' parameter.
The scanner will retrieve all keys of the hash/object and insert them in
the HList.

When the user double clicks on a key, the corresponding value will be
added in the HList. If the user use the middle button to open a tied
item, the internals of the tied object will be displayed.

If the value is a scalar, the scalar will be displayed in a popup text
window.

If the value is a code ref, the deparsed code will be displayed in a
popup text window.

This widget can be used as a regular widget in a Tk application or can
be used as an autonomous popup widget that will display the content of a
data structure. The latter is like a call to a graphical Data::Dumper.

The scanner recognizes: - tied hashes arrays or scalars - weak reference
(See weaken function of Scalar::Util for details)

*Pseudo-hashes are deprecated*

This module was tested with perl5.8.2 and Tk 804.025 (beta). But should
work with older versions of perl (> 5.6.1) or Tk.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

*Note* that test program (in the 't' directory) can be run interactively
this way :

#+begin_example
 perl t/xxx.t 1
#+end_example

*** Installation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: installation
    :END:
#+begin_example
gunzip -c <dist_file>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd <dist_directory>
perl Makefile.PL
make test          
make install
#+end_example

From github, this module is built with *Dist::Zilla*.

You must make sure that the following modules are installed:

#+begin_example
Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResources
Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prepender
Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Prereqs
Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Filter
#+end_example

On debian or ubuntu, do:

#+begin_example
sudo aptitude install \
     libdist-zilla-plugin-prepender-perl \
     libdist-zilla-plugins-cjm-perl \
     libdist-zilla-perl
#+end_example

Then run:

#+begin_example
dzil build 
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
dzil test
dzil build
#+end_example
